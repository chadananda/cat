# üìò CTAI - Committee Translation AI üìò

</div>

CTAI is a powerful AI "committee" for translating and processing book-length documents into quality classical English. It leverages the power of __decision tree logic__ üå≥ to provide high-quality translations instead of older decision logic such as __chain-of-reasoning.__

CTAI is actually composed of a multi-disciplinary committee consisting of five specific translation agents. Each agent is a capable translator from a completely different background. Each argues his (or her) logical reasoning for each translation decision. The group engages each other in debate until they eventually reach a collective translation consensus. They provide this final translation together with a technical summary explaining the challenges and reasoning behind difficult translation decisions.

The CTAI "committee" can provide translations with or without commentary, with or without original text (side-by-side) and as either a literary or technical translation style.

Since many old Arabic and Farsi manuscripts had neither punctuation nor paragraph segmentation. The CTAI application can first split long blocks of text into semantically meaningful paragraphs prior to translation. CTAI will also remove incorrect (artificial) page breaks from OCR, as well as repair hyphen-split words and common OCR errors using contextual analysis.

## üéì Meet our Committee

__Dr. Penelope Hamilton__ - An Oxford-based scholar in English literature and linguistics with a focus on Keats, Byron, Gibbon, and the King James Bible. She brings a deep understanding of classical English style to the committee. Her doctoral dissertation focused on translation challenges of Ali ibn Abi Talib's "Nahj al-Balagha".

__Professor Reza Farid__ - A leading authority in Persian classical poetry and Islamic literature in Arabic. Prof. Farid's understanding of the cultural and historical contexts of Persian and Arabic texts, especially Sufi terminology and poetic citations and allusions to Attar, Hafez and Rumi, will be crucial in maintaining the original spirit of the works. Prof. Farid has especially studied the methodology employed by Shoghi Effendi in his standard-setting translation of the Farsi Kitab-i-Iqan.

__Dr. Ahmed Bakri__ - A respected scholar in Arabic and Islamic literature, with a specific focus on Arabic and specifically Qur'anic grammar. His research and translation work on Shoghi Effendi's Arabic translations make him a key member of the team. Dr. Bakri has especially focused on the technical translation norms employed by Shoghi Effendi in his translation of the Arabic prayers in "Prayers and Meditations by Baha'u'llah" (Munajat)

__Dr. Yasmin Nouri__ - A renowned historian specializing in 19th-century Qajar Iran. Dr. Nouri's expertise will provide valuable context to the many historical allusions in the works of the B√°b, and Baha'u'llah enhancing the depth and accuracy of translations.

__Ms. Evelyn Clarke__ - A meticulous editor and English language specialist with a focus on refining translated texts for clarity, comprehensibility, and stylistic consistency. Her skills will help ensure the translated works resonate with English-speaking audiences. Ms. Clark has literary proficiency in both Arabic and Farsi and has authored academic papers on the translation choices employed by Shoghi Effendi.

**Together, these five expert AI agents create a robust and multidisciplinary committee capable of translating Baha'i literature in the style of Shoghi Effendi. Their combined skills and knowledge ensure the translations will be not only linguistically accurate but also culturally resonant and historically contextualized.**

## üìö Our Committee's Translation Process

<details open>
<summary><strong>1. Initial Translation:</strong></summary>

Each member of the committee independently translates a given paragraph from the original Arabic or Persian text. They are encouraged to leverage their individual areas of expertise while keeping in mind the style of Shoghi Effendi.

* Literary Allusions: Are references to other works of literature correctly interpreted and translated?
* Theological Terminology: Is the terminology accurate and consistent with Baha'i theology and Shoghi Effendi's translations?
* Translation Precedent: Does the translation adhere to established translation standards and precedents set by Shoghi Effendi?
* Parallel English Metaphors and Figures of Speech: Does the translation effectively use English language metaphors and figures of speech to convey the meaning of the original text?

<summary><strong>3. Individual Re-Work:</strong></summary>

Based on the group discussion, each member re-translates the paragraph, taking into account the feedback and insights gained during the discussion.
</details>

<details open>
<summary><strong>4. Cross Comparison:</strong></summary>

The committee meets again to cross compare their re-translations. They discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each version, drawing on the best elements of each to inform their final translation.
</details>

<details open>
<summary><strong>5. Collaborative Final Translation:</strong></summary>

The committee works together to produce a final translation of the paragraph. This final version incorporates the best efforts and arguments of the group, ensuring that it is an accurate, stylistically appropriate, and resonant translation of the original text.
</details>

<details open>
<summary><strong>6. Technical Summary:</strong></summary>

Finally, the committee writes up a brief technical summary detailing the challenges faced during the translation process and how they were overcome. This document serves as a record of their translation process and can be used to inform future translation efforts.
</details>

**This multi-step process ensures that the final translation is the result of a collaborative, thorough, and rigorous process, leveraging the diverse skills and expertise of the committee members. It also allows for continuous learning and improvement, as each step provides opportunities for feedback and refinement.**
