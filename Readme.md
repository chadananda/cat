# 📘 CTAI - Committee Translation AI 📘

CTAI is a powerful AI "committee" for translating and processing book-length documents into quality classical English. It leverages the concept of __tree of thought logic__ 🌳 to provide translations which are superior to __straight-shot__ requests and even better than other AI decision-enhancing logic such as __chain-of-reasoning__, __self-consistency__ or __voting.__

This is a proof of concept placeholder, preparing for later generations of AI which will have been trained on more domain-specific examples. GPT-4 is the first LLM to have adequate knowledge of Arabic literature to run such a test. To play with this tool, you will have to have API access to GPT-4 which is not yet publicly available.

__Tree of thought__ is basically a multi-input iteration on a goal. In this implementation, it is a simulation of a multi-disciplinary translation committee consisting of a handful of varied experts. Each expert has a specific set of background strengths. In our simulated committee, each expert argues his (or her) logical reasoning behind each translation decision. The group engages each other in an interative cycle of translation and debate until they eventually reach a consensus. They provide this final translation together with copious technical notes explaining the challenges and reasoning behind each difficult translation decision.

Since many old Arabic and Farsi documents have neither punctuation nor paragraph segmentation. CTAI will first split long blocks of text into semantically meaningful paragraphs prior to translation. As part of this document-prep, CTAI will also remove incorrect (artificial) page breaks introduced by typists or OCR.


## 🎓 Meet our Committee

All of our translators are capable translators of both classical Arabic and Farsi -- and have extensive experience translating Arabic and Farsi literature in the translation style of Shoghi Effendi.

__<u>👩‍🎓 Dr. Penelope Hamilton</u>__ - An Oxford-based scholar in English literature and linguistics with a focus on Keats, Byron, Gibbon, and the King James Bible. She brings to the committee a sweeping knowledge of classical English vocabulary and expression. Her doctoral dissertation treated the challenges of translating Ali ibn Abi Talib's "Nahj al-Balagha" into appropriate literary English.

__<u>👨‍🏫 Professor Reza Farid</u>__ - A leading authority in Persian classical poetry and Islamic literature. Professor Farid offers an unparalleled understanding of the cultural and historical contexts of Persian texts -- especially Sufi terminology and literary allusions to classic poets such as Attar, Hafez, and Rumi. His insights will be crucial for maintaining the layered meaning of literary works. Professor Farid has written at length on the specific methodology employed by Shoghi Effendi in his standard-setting translation of the Farsi Kitáb-i-Íqán.

__<u>👨‍🎓 Dr. Ahmed Bakri</u>__ - A preeminent scholar in the field of Arabic and Islamic literature, with a specific expertise on Qur'anic grammar and the development of Shi'ah Jurisprudence. His detailed studies of Shoghi Effendi's Arabic translations makes him a key member of the team. He has specially written on the technical translation norms employed by Shoghi Effendi in his English rendering of the Arabic "Prayers and Meditations by Bahá'u'lláh" (Munaját).

*🤝 Together, these expert AI personas constitute a robust and multidisciplinary committee capable of accurately translating Bahá'í literature using the highly literary style of Shoghi Effendi.*


## 📚 Our Committee's Translation Process

### 💡 1. Translation:
Each member of the committee independently translates a given paragraph from the original Arabic or Persian text. They are encouraged to leverage their individual areas of expertise while keeping in mind the norms established by Shoghi Effendi.

### 🗣️ 2. Group Debate & Consideration:
The committee convenes to discuss each proposed translation. They critique and compare each version considering various factors:

- 🖋️ Style: How well does the translation capture the literary style of Shoghi Effendi?
- 🕰️ Historical context: Does the translation accurately reflect the historical and cultural nuances of the original text?
- 📚 Literary Allusions: Are references to other works of literature correctly interpreted?
- ☪️ Theological Terminology: Do technical terms accurately reflect Islamic and Baha'i concepts?
- 📜 Translation Precedent: Does the translation adhere to established translation standards and terminology precedents set by Shoghi Effendi?
- 🗨️ Figurative Language Adaptation: Does the translation adeptly identify and adapt figures of speech from the original text into fitting English expressions, maintaining the essence and style of the original?

### ✍️ 3. Repeat until Achieving Consensus:
Based on the group discussion, each member re-translates the paragraph, repeating step one and two, bearing in mind corrections and insights learned from other committee members. They will continue this iterative process until arriving at consensus -- producing a final translation which all members agree is the most faithful rendering of the original in both accuracy and style.

### 📝 4. Technical Summary:
Finally, the committee marks up the paragraph with copious footnotes documenting the difficult trade-offs made in the translation work, including choices of specific terminology and figures of speech and the reasoning for each. Footnotes are meant for use by translators and will include original terms and phrases with exlanations.

*This multi-step process ensures that the final translation is the result of a collaborative, thorough, and rigorous process, leveraging the diverse skills and expertise of the committee members. It also allows for continuous learning and improvement, as each step provides opportunities for feedback and refinement.*
